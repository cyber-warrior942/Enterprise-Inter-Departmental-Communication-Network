# Enterprise-Inter-Departmental-Communication-Network
This project designs and simulates a multi-floor enterprise network in Cisco Packet Tracer, featuring VLAN segmentation, inter-VLAN routing, and a core infrastructure to ensure secure, scalable, and seamless connectivity across departments while optimizing resource utilization.

# Key Features:
**VLAN-Based Segmentation:** Each department is assigned a unique VLAN to isolate and secure traffic, improving performance and manageability.

**Inter-VLAN Routing:** Implemented using OSPF to enable communication between different VLANs across multiple floors.

**Core Network Design:** A robust core infrastructure using Cisco 2911 routers and a Catalyst 6503-E multilayer switch for efficient routing and scalability.

**Device Integration:**  Wired and wireless devices (PCs, laptops, tablets, printers) are connected within the VLANs, with wireless devices leveraging AccessPoints.

**Server Room:**  Centralized servers (Email and DNS) are accessible to all VLANs, ensuring resource availability.

**SSH Configuration Access:** Users can securely authenticate via SSH to configure switches and routers across the network.

# Technologies Used:
**Networking Devices:**  Cisco 2911 routers, Catalyst 6503-E multilayer switch, AccessPoint-PT, PCs, printers, servers.

**Protocols:** OSPF for routing, VLAN for segmentation, and SSH for secure device management.

**Tools:**  Cisco Packet Tracer for simulation and testing.

# Future Scope:
This project can be extended by incorporating features like advanced security policies (firewalls, IDS/IPS), redundancy protocols (HSRP/VRRP), and Quality of Service (QoS) for traffic prioritization. The design is also adaptable to IPv6 and cloud integration to support future expansion.
Feel free to explore, modify, and extend this project to suit your needs. Contributions are welcome!
# Repository Contents:
